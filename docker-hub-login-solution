Error saving credentials: error storing credentials - err: exit status 1, out: `The connection is closed`

-install the following Packages in ubuntu fixed my issue

#sudo apt install gnupg2 pass

-but it saved credentials in clear text. Here's the solution if you want to keep them in a password store.

1) Download docker-credential-pass from https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases

2) tar -xvf docker-credential-pass.tar.gz

3) chmod u+x docker-credential-pass

4) mv docker-credential-pass /usr/bin

5) You will need to setup docker-credential-pass (following steps are based of https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/102#issuecomment-388634452)

5.1) install gpg and pass (apt-get install gpg pass)

5.2) gpg --generate-key, enter your information. You should see something like this:

pub   rsa3072 2018-10-07 [SC] [expires: 2020-10-06]
      1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
Copy the 123... line

5.3) pass init 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 (paste)

5.4) pass insert docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check and set the next password "pass is initialized" (without quotes).

5.5) pass show docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check. You should see pass is initialized.

5.6) docker-credential-pass list

6) create a ~/.docker/config.json with:

{
"credsStore": "pass"
}
7) docker login should now work

Note: If you get the error "pass store is uninitialized" in future run, run the below command (it will reload the pass store in memory):

pass show docker-credential-helpers/docker-pass-initialized-check

It will ask your password and it will initialize the pass store.

I faced the same issue in ubuntu 18.08 and this finally worked for me.. as a temporary solution.

I had created this folder home/.docker/ as some solutions suggested me to create a file config.json and write default credentials in it i.e.

{
    "credsStore": "pass"
}
I deleted this file config.json.
Then renamed docker-credential-secretservice to something else so that it doesn't picks up this file.

sudo mv /usr/bin/docker-credential-secretservice /usr/bin/docker-credential-secretservice_x

and it worked!
